## v4.1.0
- [#11](https://github.com/arifire21/744-survey/issues/11) Adding image upload capability to form
    - frontend buttons
    - image preview
    - image size state variable (Vercel has limit of 4.5MB)
    - server upload / api

## v4.1.1
- added modal to pit results view, for better viewing on mobile devices
- fixed image preview breaking when re-uploading (used `parentNode.remove(element)` instead of `element.remove`)
- moved `match.module.css`

## v4.2.1
- [Match Survey] Production Bug fixed [#26](https://github.com/arifire21/744-survey/issues/26)
    - was not explicitly returning `return res.json()` in `getData()`. This lead to it being consumed without being passed to `pitDataHelper()` (which is what helps sets the state variables)
- App mode clarification:
    - changed "postseason" to "offseason" to stay in consistent with verbiage
    - "offseason mode" will now be set up to link to the past years' databases
    - "hiatus mode" will now now do what "postseason mode" did - not allow users to submit new records, only view ones from past matches/competitions
- [Pit Survey] added correct `submitHelper()` method to file
- [Pit Survey] changed `handleImages()` to `handleImageAssignmentPreview()` for clearer naming
- if no images are uploaded (~~`[ref].current.files` has a length of 0~~ if `img.hasOwnProperty('files')`, because it becomes a `File` Object, and loses the `files` array property), `uploadImage()` will return `null` prematurely (`frontImgBlobURL` or `sideImgBlobURL` set to `null`) and not attempt to run its API call
    - caught hidden oversight of not resetting refs after submitting (images could be resubmitted accidentally even without uploading any new ones, the ref would still exist)
- [Pit Results] added check for duplicate team numbers avoid any possible "duplicate key" warnings
- [Pit Results] caught overlooked bug of RadioGroup suddenly having an `<empty string>` value. Switched `onClick` event to `onChange` as per MUI docs, and it is now a proper "controlled component."
- API: updated returned error object to display proper error text
- FIXME: fixing image size state render is on hold, is QOL fix and not pressing bug
- FIXME: found occasional API error where a value goes over SQL field 20 char limit?

## v4.3.1
- [#30](https://github.com/arifire21/744-survey/issues/30)
    - refactored match results API to return rows in an easier-to-use format
    - overhaul of results rendering, now grouped by match number and alliance in AccordionGroups
    - added ternaries to render to catch possible missed fields
    - added original blue `joy-primary` pallette back to use for blue alliance items
        - needed dark *and* light palettes defined in order to define customs
